## Introduction

The tool to assess which spatialization method is the most appropriate is a benchmarking experiment.

## Room for manoeuvre : 

### Stations

* which of Pameseb ? 
* which of RMI ?
* Pameseb correcred Humain model ?

### Learners

* baseLearners (= ZEPP)
* UpgradedLearners 
* ExplorativeLearners

### Explanatory variables

These variables must already be available as spatialized data in order to be used as explanaotry variables.

#### Temperature (tsa) prediction

* lat + lon
* altitude
* incaAnalysis (=T0)
* ens

#### Relative humidity (hra) prediction

* lat + lon
* alt
* incaAnalysis
* ens

## Organization of the work

### bmrs

Benchmark experiments will be conducted on 2 years dataset of both __HOURLY__ and __DAILY__ records.
From these benchmarks we obtain :
