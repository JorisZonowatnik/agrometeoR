## R Markdown

```{r}
twoYears = makeDataset(json = "../data-raw/extdata/AGROMET/twoYears.json", sensor = "tsa")

summary(twoYears)

tasks = makeTasks(dataset = twoYears, target = "tsa")

data("learners")

ZEPP = learners$lrn.lm.alt_x_y
bmr = makeBenchmark(parallel = TRUE, cores = 4, tasks = tasks, learners = ZEPP)
```


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
