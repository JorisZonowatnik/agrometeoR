# AgrometeoR

## Introduction 

This R Package is dedicated to "Automatic Weather Station" (AWS) Network data spatialization. It is currently being developed by the [CRA-W](http://www.cra.wallonie.be) in the context of the [Agromet Project](./articles/presentation-agromet-project.html).

In short, the aim of the Agromet project is to provide a near real-time hourly gridded datasets of weather parameters (Air temperature, rainfall, relative humidity and leaves wetness) at the resolution of 1 kmÂ² for the whole region of Wallonia

This package constitutes the core of the spatialization process of weather data. It makes an heavy use of [mlr](https://mlr.mlr-org.com/index.html) package and its unified interface for Machine Learning (ML) algorithms benchmarking.

Many vignettes documenting our development process are availbale. Check them to understand our development strategy !

## Installation

### Prerequisites

You can install this package using [devtools](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/) package. We highly recommand you to use [packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) package for you projects relying on this package. Doing so will ensure you have a sandbox environment with all the required versions of packages needed to make it work. 

As this package requires geographic/spatial capabilities, you will also need multiple system dependencies. This package was developped under a containerized Debian environment based on the [rocker/tidyverse](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/tidyverse/) docker image. This dockerized environment is available on docker hub under the name [pokyah/agrometeordocker](https://hub.docker.com/r/pokyah/agrometeordocker/). As stated in the docker file of our developement container, multiple Linux Debian OS dependencies are required to make our package work (full list specified in the installation instruction paragraph).

You will also of course need R to make the package works !  

### Instructions

1. Install The Debian dependencies required. To do this, simply open a termina, paste and execute the following line : 

```bash
# installation of OS dependencies
sudo apt-get update \
    && sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common \
    && sudo apt-get update -q \
    && sudo apt-get install -y \
      texlive-full \
      jq \
      libjq-dev \
      libv8-3.14-dev \
      libprotobuf-dev \
      protobuf-compiler \
      libjq-dev \
      openssh-server \
      libxml2-dev \
      libssl-dev \
      libcurl4-openssl-dev \
      libgeos-dev \
      libcairo2-dev \
      libudunits2-dev \
      gdal-bin \
      libgdal-dev \
      libproj-dev \
      freeglut3 \
      freeglut3-dev \
      mesa-common-dev \
      default-jdk \
      r-cran-rjava \
    && sudo apt-get clean \ 
    && sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/ \ 
    && sudo rm -rf /tmp/downloaded_packages/ /tmp/*.rds \
```
2. Install R, if not yet installed on your machine

```bash
sudo apt install dirmngr
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-key 'E19F5F87128899B192B1A2C2AD5F960A256A04AF'
sudo apt update
sudo apt install r-base
```

3. Install the two system wide required packages : devtools (to install packages from github) and packrat (to install all the other packages in a sandbox environment). To do so, open your R console and type the following : 

```r
install.packages(devtools)
install.packages(packrat)
```

4. Create a folder for your project and enable packrat for this folder




5. Install the agrometeoR package. In your R console : 

```r
devtools::install_github("pokyah/agrometeoR", ref = "master")
```

This command will automatically install all the required R packages needed to make this package work (these are specified in the [DESCRIPTION](./DESCRIPTION) file of the package) into your project packrat private library




* add your API key into your `~/.Renviron` file ==> `AGROMET_API_V1_KEY = <YOUR_TOKEN>`
* detailed tutorials available in articles section



## Features

* query the agromet DB using an API
* spatialize an hourly our daily (soon) dataset using a specified learner and output a geojson file
* conduct benchmark experiment to compare and rank various learners, hyperparameters and features (explanatory variables) according to your desired performance metrics
* quickly create an interactive leaflet map for data vizualization (soon)
* an interactive tutorial about R as a GIS

## target variables

The target weather parameter values at the stations are 

## explanatory variables

### static

All the static explanatory variables were prepared both for the stations locations and the RMI inca grid points locations. The script used to generate these datasets is available under `./data-raw/makeData.R`

The currently available static explanatory variables are :

`elevation`, `aspect`, `slope`, `Y` (lat), `X` (lon), `Agricultural_areas`, `Artificials_surfaces`, `Forest`,  `Herbaceous_vegetation`, `Water`

The script used to generate the static explanatory variables datasets (`grid.df` and `stations.df`) are available under `./raw-data/makeData.R` 

### dynamic 

These are not yet implemented as they require a working API to make queries in our Agromet DB.

## learners

The package will allow you to use a configuration where you can list the various learning algorithms you want to use to spatialize data
