\title{spatialize a gridded dataset using a mlr model}
\usage{
makeSpatialization(model, pred.grid = grid.df)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{an object of class mlr::train() that contains the prediction model}

\item{pred.grid}{an object of class sf::st_makegrid(). This object must contains the same column names as the task on which the model has been trained}
}
\value{
a 2 elements named list : (1) snitch and (2) output. snitch is TRUE if function has provided the expected result. output is a named list which contains
(1) value : an object of class list where first element is a data.frame containing the spatialized data and the second element is a data.frame containing the summary data
(2) condition : a character specifying if the functions has encountered success, warning, error
(3) message : the message relative to the condition
}

# create the model

# spatialize using the trained model

# get the relevant information

# show the summary stats of spatialized data
